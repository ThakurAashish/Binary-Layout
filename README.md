# Binary-Layout
The binary layout refers to the way data is represented, stored, and organized in binary form (0s and 1s) inside a computer’s memory or storage. Since computers only understand binary, every type of data—numbers, text, images, instructions—must be converted into sequences of bits (binary digits).
